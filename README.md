# face-recogintion-project
 This project presents development of face recognition for student attendance using Raspberry Pi. 
Face recognition is highly efficient and an accurate tool in enhancing security with nano devices such as
Raspberry Pi and Raspberry Pi night vision cameras, lecturers record student attendance to class with
face-to-face identification systems. Small night-vision Raspberry cameras are installed on the classroom 
door frame in the classroom to capture video, Approved to Raspberry Pi for face detection and recognition.
The proposed method is implemented on Raspberry Pi and Raspberry Pi night vision which is tested 
on various standard datasets. Experimental results validated the efficiency of the proposed recognition 
method.
